## [Personal Blog](https://blog.mucahitugur.com)

This fork of [freek.dev](https://github.com/spatie/freek.dev) includes my personal customizations as well as a personal finance tracker in nova and an admin interface which makes it possible to create, edit and delete blog posts in addition to nova.

## Experience

This blog project which was my first laravel project helped me to experiment, learn and practice on notions such as:

- User authorization with [Laravel Forify](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/fortify)


- Building blade views and layouts using [Template Inheritance](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#layouts-using-template-inheritance)


- Building administration panels with [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/)


- Debugging with [Laravel Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/telescope)


- Customizing a markdown editor with [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor)


- Importing excel files with [Laravel Excel](https://github.com/SpartnerNL/Laravel-Excel)


- Serving different locales with [mcamara/laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization)


- And many others with many great spatie packages including but not limited to:
  - [spatie/laravel-backup](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-backup)
  - [spatie/laravel-medialibrary](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary)
  - [spatie/laravel-tags](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-tags)
